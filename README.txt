OVERVIEW
BeeBus project will be a website that takes in users, 
and allows them to use the list of info,quiz Q&A,
spelling words our site provides, to train to win 
Gepgraphy bees, history bees,spelling bees etc.

FEATURES
User login: Users will be able to log in, either by creating accounts 
in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider
 (e.g. Google Authentication). 
All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.

they are training for, in the system by entering in a mixture of

optional fields (description, area of expertise being tested, etc)

that store bee information to the system, and to assign importance to entities.

 websites&databases.


TECHNOLOGIES
. Java
. MySQL


What I will have to learn

. Link my website to a database, using MySQL.
. Verify user authentification.
. Password srambling
. RegEx


For the login functionality, I'll have to learn something new in either scenario. If I choose to use native login functionality for the site, I'll need to learn how to use the login approach outlined in the spring-filter-based-auth repository. If I choose to use third-party authentcation, I'll need to learn how to use an OAuth2 provider such as Google Authentication.
I'll also be using test-driven development, writing tests for my code before writing the code itself. I don't have much experience doing this in Spring, so I'll have to learn how to use its testing capabilities.
